<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>
  This <i>Pseudolithos migiurtinus</i> is weird little wrinkled wart of a plant
  and I just love it. As its name suggests (Pseudolithos means "false stone"),
  it is a dwarf succulent native to Sommalia's rocky arid environments that
  resembles a small stone or pebble. The leafless stem is knobby and
  subspherical: the lower half a U-shape while the top rounds out, which reminds
  me of a muffin.
</p>
<p><strong>Growth pattern</strong></p>
<p>
  At the top of this plant is a set of 4 rows of symmetrical and hexagonal
  tubercles extending from the central crown in a cross-like tessallation
  pattern. In each row, in the valley between two large tubercles is a
  olive-green bud that I assume will turn into a flower.
</p>
<p>
  As it grows, wrinkles between the tubercles deepen into intricate,
  fractal-like patterns. However, the bottom half of the stem stays relatively
  smooth as it doesn't have the same wrinkling pattern in between the
  tubercles.Observing this growth over the past ~8 months really has been a
  treat.
</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong></p>
<p>
  This plant is tiny, measuring at only 17.86mm wide when I received it on
  October 21 2024, and it has grown only an additional ~4mm over the past 8
  months. I didn't measure its height when I first received it, but it has
  noticeably grown more taller, with its height at ~23.16mm above the soil line.
</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>
  When it arrived, the color of the stem was a vibrant lime green color. 8
  months later, the quite intense lighting from my T5 light bulbs has changed
  its color to muted blue-green color. In addition, the flaking of the epidermal
  skin cells has dulled it into a pleasing blue-green color.
